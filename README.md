# Scalargrad

A blind rewrite from micrograd, with extra activation functions. Perhaps useful for educational purposes only. Really, _really_ slow, at anything else rather than binary classification.

## Extras

Since week 6 of STA414, Probabilistic machine learning did not have a neural network tutorial, this is hugely beneficial for understanding not only DAG, but also backpropagation. From slides we have an example of XOR classification implemented, as well as a classification problem for pokemon unknowns from assignment 1.

p.s. pokemon unknown is just painfully slow and memory expensive, definitely just for implementation reading purposes.
